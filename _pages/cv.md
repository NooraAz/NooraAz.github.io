### Who am I?

I am a second year Ph.D. candidate in the Parisa H. Lab at University of Oregon.

### What do I do? (briefly)

I have three projects in hand that evolve around cyclic peptides:
1. Prediction of membrane permeability of cyclic peptides (main)
2. Structure prediction of cyclic peptides (in collaboration with Andrew Powers)
3. Developing a new assay for membrane permeability of cyclic peptides (advised by my PI)

A more detailed information is available on [Projects](https://nooraaz.github.io/Projects/) page.
