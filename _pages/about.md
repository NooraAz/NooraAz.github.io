My name is Noora, and I'm currently a Bioengineering grad student at the University of Oregon. 

### Interests:

I love a mixture of design, computation, and biology in my work, and that's what I'm doing right now. I work on peptide structures using computational approaches.

### Hobbies: 
In my free time, I'd like to read books, take photos, watch documantaries, and write short stories or poems.
