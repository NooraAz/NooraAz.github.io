Writing scp long codes each time for moving files between remote and local server can be frustrating. On windows people use Winscp which makes things much easier. The same thing can be done on mac with FileZilla:

1. Downlad and install Filezilla client from their website:
[Downlad Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
2. Open it and fill in the Host, username and password for your remote server.

4. click quick connect. 
5. if it failed, write 22 in port section and try again. it should work.
6. Then you can just drag and drop files to copy them between two servers.
